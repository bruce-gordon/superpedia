## Abstract
Superpedia utilizes the api provided by ComicVine which links to their database of comic book characters.  Superpedia allows users to search for a range of comic book characters by name, view results, save results, and get more detailed information about each of their results.  This app is ideal for anyone newly introduced to comic book lore via film and television, or for a returning fan looking for more details about a favorite character.

## Process
This project stayed true to the original concept and wireframe throughout development.  One idea for an extension was to include a form that allows the user to create their own comic character by completing the required fields.  The user would then see their custom character in the same format as their search results, and could save the character as well.  I considered adding this extension but was not able to complete that component by the project deadline.  There were unexpected issues involving access to the ComicVine api that required me to spend time researching proxy servers.  I am pleased with the outcome of my api troubleshooting and will still consider the create-your-own-super as a future extension.

## Reflection
This was the first project in which I was solely responsible for applying Router and writing all tests (including async testing).  I am pleased with the outcome and with my own growth in applying these concepts to my existing React foundation.

## Learning Goals
- Build a React app utilizing API data.
- Create a multipage UX using Router.
- Successfully test components in React and asynchronous Javascript.
- Provide users with the ability to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list.
